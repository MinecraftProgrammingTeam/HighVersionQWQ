# HighVersionPVP
 A pvp plugin for higher version

# Usage

Use command `/jointeam Red/Blue/red/blue <PlayerName>` to join a team

There must be at least two players join each team to start a game

When the game started, the `BossBar` of another team's player's health will be shown at your screen.

When you beat the other person, you won the game.

So far, we have only two teams and they are sticked at Red & Blue, and the argument `<PlayerName>` does not support target selector like `@p、@s`. It will be fixed s∞n .
